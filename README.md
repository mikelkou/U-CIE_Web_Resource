# CIELAB
Anyone who works with high dimensional data often comes across the need of visualization, which is a particularly efficient way of communicating when data is numerous. Since colors play a crucial role in this process, we developed U-CIE (https://u-cie.jensenlab.org/), a freely available web resource, that can also be installed as an R package. U-CIE color encodes high dimensional data and aims to capture much of their original structure using CIELab color space and state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction techniques, if necessary.
